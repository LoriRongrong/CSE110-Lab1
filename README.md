You can visit my [personal website](https://lorirongrong.github.io/Me/) to see what's going on in my life and what I am up to. I **tried** to update the code during the winter break but I was occupied by other things in my life. 

## Quotes 
Some words really inspired me, like:
> “Don’t Let Yesterday Take Up Too Much Of Today.” – Will Rogers

Some code really inspired me, like:
```
