You can visit my [personal website](https://lorirongrong.github.io/Me/) to see my resume and my projec! I **tried** to update the code during the winter break but I was occupied by other things in my life. 

## I sometime find quotes interesting
Some words really inspired me. The one below is interesting because I often struggle too much with past mistakes.
> “Don’t Let Yesterday Take Up Too Much Of Today.” – Will Rogers

Some code really inspired me because how prevalent they are, like:
```
hello world 
```
